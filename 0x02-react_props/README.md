### REACT-PROPS

Props are an important concept to understand in React. You use props to pass data and values from one component to another to get dynamic and unique outputs.


## What are React Props?
Props in React are inputs that you pass into components. The props enable the component to access customised data, values, and pieces of information that the inputs hold.

The term 'props' is an abbreviation for 'properties' which refers to the properties of an object.
